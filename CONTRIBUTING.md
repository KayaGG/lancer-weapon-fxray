## Dev Setup

### Setup

This repository uses Node.js to provide tooling. Download and install the [latest runtime](https://nodejs.org/en).

Then, run the following:

```bash
npm clean-install
npm run build
```

### Creating and Editing Macros

The workflow for creating and editing macros is as follows:

- To create a new macro, run `npm run new-effect "My Weapon Name"`
- To edit an existing macro, edit the files in `packs_source/weaponfxray/<folder name>/<macro name>.[js|json]`

The "Effects" folder is the default. To create a macro in a different pack, use `--type <type>`, for example: `npm run new-effect "My Manual Name" -- --type manual`. Use `npm run new-effect -- --help` for more information.

### Testing Macros

First, compile the macro compendium with `npm run db:pack`. You can then copy the module files (or symlink the folder) into your Foundry modules directory to test in-game.

Note that may have to return to the setup screen in order for Foundry to unlock the compendium database files, and allow them to be overwritten.
